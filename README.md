# QuadWorld
Sandbox game for Android.

Technology: Java + OpenGL ES 2.0
Currently as Eclipse project, but I will try to migrate it to Android Studio soon.

In this game you are able to explore the fantastic QuadWorld. Modify the world, combine the elements, create new stuff and fill the world.
Pick up elements by tapping on them. Combine them by putting them next to each other in certain patterns.
